The potential benefits of frustum-shaped magnets over cuboidal magnets have been seldom studied. This paper compares these magnet shapes by optimising frustum geometry for both a single magnet and for a multi-magnet planar Halbach array to produce a desirable field\footnote{In this chapter, optimisation for a single magnet refers to maximising the field strength per unit magnet volume, and optimisation for an array refers to minimising the cost function defined in Equation (\ref{eqn:p3CostFunction})}. This field is compared to the equivalent field for optimised cuboidal magnets and differences quantified. A single magnet is considered, where the field strength above the centre of a magnet is maximised. If the field is measured close to the magnet surface, an optimised frustum magnet can produce a field stronger than an optimised cuboidal magnet. If the field is measured further from the magnet, there is little benefit in using a frustum magnet over a cuboid. Additionally, a planar magnet array is considered, in which the field strength and how closely the field resembled a sinusoidal profile are maximised. In this case, no significant benefit is observed using frustum magnets over cuboidal magnets.
