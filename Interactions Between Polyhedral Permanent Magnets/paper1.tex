\section*{Author's remarks on Chapter \ref{chap:paper1}}
The field equations presented in this chapter enable the evaluation of the magnetic field due to any polyhedral permanent magnet with constant uniform magnetisation and a relative permeability of unity. However, the methodology has several limitations that reduce the effectiveness of field evaluation. The most significant limitation is that of scaling; if the number of points at which the field is calculated is doubled, the methodology will take approximately twice as long to evaluate the field. This is because the entire process, including the deconstruction of the geometry, must be performed uniquely for each field point. In many situations, a large number of field points is desired, such as estimating forces and torques, optimising the field due to a magnet array (Chapter \ref{chap:paper3}), or modelling magnetic permeability (Chapter \ref{chap:paper4}). In addition, singularities in the equations exist for points on the same plane as the magnet facets. These limitations necessitate an alternative methodology which scales well with many field calculations and includes treatment of any singularities in the field equations.
