abstract = {This article outlines an algorithm which analytically calculates the magnetic field produced by a general polyhedral permanent magnet with any number of faces and arbitrary face orientations, then uses the algorithm to semi-analytically calculate the force and torque on a second general polyhedral magnet. The algorithm is validated against both the literature and finite element simulations using cuboids and dodecahedra. It is then used to model a basic two-magnet repulsive system, where it is shown that frustum magnets can produce a larger force per unit volume than cuboidal magnets. The shape of the frustums is optimized to maximize the force between them at a given separation distance, showing a considerable increase in force when compared with cuboidal magnets with the same volume. This article shows that there is scope to improve the performance of magnetic systems by using novel magnet shapes and presents an algorithm which can be used for this optimization process.},

abstract = {This paper presents a synthesis of analytical calculations of magnetic parameters (field, force, torque, stiffness) in cylindrical magnets and coils. By using the equivalence between the amperian current model and the coulombian model of a magnet, we show that a thin coil or a cylindrical magnet axially magnetized have the same mathematical model. Consequently, we present first the analytical expressions of the magnetic field produced by either a thin coil or a ring permanent magnet whose polarization is axial, thus completing similar calculations already published in the scientific literature. Then, this paper deals with the analytical calculation of the force and the stiffness between thin coils or ring permanent magnets axially magnetized. Such configurations can also be modeled with the same mathematical approach. Finally, this paper presents an analytical model of the mutual inductance between two thin coils in air. Throughout this paper, we emphasize why the equivalence between the coulombian and the amperian current models is useful for studying thin coils or ring permanent magnets. All our analytical expressions are based on elliptic integrals but do not require further numerical treatments. These expressions can be implemented in Mathematica or Matlab and are available online. All our models have been compared to previous analytical and semianalytical models. In addition, these models have been compared to the finite-element method. The computational cost of our analytical model is very low, and we find a very good agreement between our analytical model and the other approaches presented in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents the exact analytical formulation of the three components of the magnetic field created by a radially magnetized tile permanent magnet. These expressions take both the magnetic pole surface densities and the magnetic pole volume density into account. So, this means that the tile magnet curvature is completely taken into account. Moreover, the magnetic field can be calculated exactly in any point of the space, should it be outside the tile magnet or inside it. Consequently, we have obtained an accurate 3D magnetic field as no simplifying assumptions have been used for calculating these three magnetic components. Thus, this result is really interesting. Furthermore, the azimuthal component of the field can be determined without any special functions. In consequence, its computational cost is very low which is useful for optimization purposes. Besides, all the other expressions obtained are based on elliptic functions or special functions whose numerical calculation is fast and robust and this allows us to realize parametric studies easily. Eventually, we show the interest of this formulation by applying it to one example: the calculation and the optimization of alternate magnetization magnet devices. Such devices are commonly used in various application fields: sensors, motors, couplings, etc. The point is that the total field is calculated by using the superposition theorem and summing the contribution to the field of each tile magnet in any point of the space. This approach is a good alternative to a finite element method because the calculation of the magnetic field is done without any simplifying assumption.},

abstract = {Vibration isolation systems incorporating linear mechanical springs exhibit the undesirable characteristic of changing resonance frequency with changing payload mass. Previous research at the University of Adelaide and elsewhere has demonstrated the theoretical feasibility of vibration isolation devices utilising magnetic springs as a means of achieving a constant resonance frequency across a range of payload masses due to their nonlinear force-displacement relationship. A conceptual prototype design is presented for a levitating magnet vibration isolation device which aims to achieve a load-independent resonance frequency across a range of payload masses via the use of inclined magnetic springs. Quasi-static and dynamic system models which informed the design process are presented, as well as a finite-element model aimed at validating the assumptions of the quasi-static system model for a select set of system states. Challenges related to the conflicting design requirements of stability, low transmissibility and load-independent resonance frequency are addressed, and an experimental framework for testing the real prototype is outlined.},

Example computations are given for the interactions between pairs of uniformly magnetized spheres (for which analytical results are compared to numerical results), cubes, octahedra, tetrahedra, and cuboctahedra. The accuracy of the derived numerical relations for energy, force, and torques is of the order of 0.1{\%} for object spacings smaller than the object dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper describes the effects of changing the magnet shape of permanent magnets (PMs) in a Halbach array applied in a slotless tubular actuator. More specifically, the square shaped magnets are replaced by trapezoidal shaped magnets. A semi-analytical magnetic field solution of regular square shaped magnets is presented and used to approximate the airgap field produced by the trapezoidal shaped PMs. The method is based on dividing the magnets into several radial layers and superposition of the fields to calculate the total magnetic field. The results are compared to finite element analysis (FEA) and show excellent agreement. Using this magnetic field solution, the effect of the shape of the magnets on the magnetic field waveform is analyzed by means of a parametric search. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {A comparative analysis is performed for linear motors adopting conventional and multi-segmented trapezoidal (MST) magnet arrays, respectively, for a high-precision positioning system. The proposed MST magnet array is a modified version of a Halbach magnet array. The MST array has trapezoidal magnets with variable shape and dimensions while the Halbach magnet array generally has a rectangular magnet with identical dimensions. We propose a new model that can describe the magnetic field resulting from the complex-shaped magnets. The model can be applied to both MST and conventional magnet arrays. Using the model, a design optimization of the two types of linear motors is performed and compared. The magnet array with trapezoidal magnets can produce more force than one with rectangular magnets when they are arrayed in a linear motor where there is a yoke with high permeability. After the optimization and comparison, we conclude that the linear motor with the MST magnet array can generate more actuating force per volume than the motor with the conventional array. In order to satisfy the requirements of next generation systems such as high resolution, high speed, and long stroke, the use of a linear motor with a MST array as an actuator in a high precision positioning system is recommended from the results obtained here. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This can be improved upon by employing nonlinear mounts incorporating negative stiffness elements configured in such a way that the dynamic stiffness is much less than the static stiffness. Such nonlinear mounts are used widely in practice, but rigorous analysis, and hence a clear understanding of their behaviour is not readily available in the literature. In this paper, a simple system comprising a vertical spring acting in parallel with two oblique springs is studied. It is shown that there is a unique relationship between the geometry and the stiffness of the springs that yields a system with zero dynamic stiffness at the static equilibrium position. The dynamic stiffness increases monotonically with displacement either side of the equilibrium position, and this is least severe when the oblique springs are inclined at an angle between approximately 48° and 57°. Finally, it is shown that the force-displacement characteristic of the system can be approximated by a cubic equation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Both theoretical and experimental tests show that the potential well escape phenomenon can be used to broaden the frequency response of an energy harvester. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper presents an improvement of the calculation of the magnetic field components created by ring permanent magnets. The three-dimensional approach taken is based on the Coulombian Model. Moreover, the magnetic field components are calculated without using the vector potential or the scalar potential. It is noted that all the expressions given in this paper take into account the magnetic pole volume density for ring permanent magnets radially magnetized. We show that this volume density must be taken into account for calculating precisely the magnetic field components in the near-field or the far-field. Then, this paper presents the component switch theorem that can be used between infinite parallelepiped magnets whose cross-section is a square. This theorem implies that the magnetic field components created by an infinite parallelepiped magnet can be deducted from the ones created by the same parallelepiped magnet with a perpendicular magnetization. Then, we discuss the validity of this theorem for axisymmetric problems (ring permanent magnets). Indeed, axisymmetric problems dealing with ring permanent magnets are often treated with a 2D approach. The results presented in this paper clearly show that the two-dimensional studies dealing with the optimization of ring permanent magnet dimensions cannot be treated with the same precisions as 3D studies.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present novel analytical expressions which describe the 3D magnetic field of arbitrarily magnetized triangular-shaped charged surfaces. These versatile expressions model that the field of triangular-shaped permanent magnets (PMs) are very suitable to model skewed slotless machines. Design/methodology/approach - The analytical 3D surface charge method is normally used to provide field expressions for PMs in free space. In this paper, the analytical surface charge integrals are analytically solved for charged right-triangular surfaces. The resulting field is compared with that obtained by finite element modeling (FEM) and subsequently applied in two examples. Findings - The comparison with FEM shows that the 3D analytical expressions are very accurate and exhibit very low-numerical noise. These fast-solving versatile expressions are therefore considered suitable to model triangular-shaped or polyhedral-shaped PMs. Research limitations/ implications - The surface charge method assumes that the relative permeability is equal to 1 and therefore soft-magnetic materials need to be modeled using the method of images. The PMs are assumed to be ideal in terms of homogeneity, magnetization vector, permeability, demagnetization, and geometrical tolerances. Practical implications - Many applications, such as the subclass of slotless synchronous linear actuators with a skewed PM structure and planar magnetic bearings, are very suitable to incorporate this modeling technique, since it enables the analysis of a variety of performance data. Originality/value - As an addition to the common 3D analytical field expressions for cuboidal or cylindrical PMs, this paper presents novel expressions for magnets having triangular surfaces. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Most of the systems working by magnet interactions can be calculated by superposition of the interactions between parallelepiped elementary magnets. Each elementary magnet is submitted to a force and a torque. By 3-D fully analytical calculation, up to now, only the force components problem has been solved. It was published for the first time in 1984. Until now, the torque components have never been analytically calculated because of the angular derivation. We have solved it, so that now all the interactions (energy, three forces components, and three torque components) can be expressed by analytical formulations. The only hypothesis is that the magnetizations J and J'are supposed to be rigid and uniform in each magnet. The analytical calculation is made by replacing magnetizations by distributions of magnetic charges on the magnet poles. The torque is calculated for rotational movement of the second magnet around its center. The three components of the torque are written with functions based on logarithm and arc-tangent. The results have been verified and validated by comparison with finite-element calculation. Analytical calculation owns many advantages in comparison with other calculation methods. The 3-D analytical expressions are difficult to obtain, but the expressions of energy, force, and torque are very simple to use. For example, the analytical expression can be included in optimization software allowing to directly obtaining the shape optimization by a fast way. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Negative stiffness mechanisms have seen renewed attention in recent years for their ability to reduce the resonance frequency of a structure without impeding their load-bearing ability. Such systems are often described as having quasi-zero stiffness when the negative stiffness is tuned to reduce the overall stiffness of the system as close to zero as possible without creating an instability. The system analysed in this work consists of a vertical spring for load bearing, and two symmetric inclined springs which behave with a snap-through effect to achieve negative stiffness. While this structure has been analysed extensively in the literature, generally only the stiffness in the vertical direction has been considered in the past. Here, the horizontal stiffness is assessed as well, and it is shown that it is possible to achieve quasi-zero stiffness in both directions simultaneously if the spring stiffnesses and pre-loads are chosen appropriately. Attention is paid to the tuning required in order to set the equilibrium point at a position which is arbitrarily close to having quasi-zero stiffness while avoiding issues arising from mechanical instability.},

Design criteria are imposed on the system to satisfy mass loading, bandwidth of the required isolation, expected magnitude of the vibration disturbance and required robustness of the system. The vibration response of a system designed to satisfy these requirements is compared to an equivalent linear system and is shown to become increasingly nonlinear as the system moves towards instability. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},
