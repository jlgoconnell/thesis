\section*{Author's remarks on Chapter \ref{chap:paper3}}
This chapter demonstrated the optimisation of both a singular magnet and a planar array of magnets. For the singular magnet case, the geometry was varied to maximise the magnetic field strength at a point above the centre of the magnet. In the case of the planar magnet array, the array geometry was varied to maximise a cost function associated with the magnetic field above the array. The cost function chosen was a simple two-dimensional sinusoidal pattern, but the choice of cost function has a strong dependence on the application being optimised. Therefore, the results presented in this chapter may not be optimal for every application, but give an indication of the subspace of where the optimal geometry may be. Due to the complexity of the optimisation problem in this chapter, fast field calculation methods such as detailed in Chapter \ref{chap:paper2} were necessary to achieve a solution to the problem in a reasonable time. This chapter has shown a proof of concept in magnetostatic geometry optimisation using efficient field calculations.
