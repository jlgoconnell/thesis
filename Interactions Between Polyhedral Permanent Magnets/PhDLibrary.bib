  abstract  = {The study of magnetism was an important field of Renaissance natural philosophy and the practical sciences. Scholars examined the powers of the magnet (i.e., the lodestone or loadstone) by experiments and observed the magnetic properties of the Earth, for example, the direction and declination of the compass needle, by means of instruments and long-term observations. In 1600, William Gilbert published the first extensive study on magnetism (De magnete) and claimed the Earth was a giant magnet. While most philosophers rooted in medieval Scholasticism and Galenism deemed it impossible to analyze the physical causes of magnetic phenomena, several Renaissance philosophers attempted to explain the powers of the magnet within a range of different philosophical frameworks. Philosophers such as Pierre Gassendi and René Descartes imagined particles being emitted by a magnet, while others attributed animal-like behavior to it. Aside from this type of investigation, magnetism also figured as an explanatory principle or as an analogy in various contexts. The very term magnetismus, for example, was coined by Andreas Libavius in a 1597 work on alchemy. During the seventeenth century, a controversy emerged around Gilbert’s “magnetic philosophy,” which accounted for the diurnal rotation of the Earth by its magnetic power. Johannes Kepler even considered certain planetary movements as caused by the magnetism of the sun.},

Design criteria are imposed on the system to satisfy mass loading, bandwidth of the required isolation, expected magnitude of the vibration disturbance and required robustness of the system. The vibration response of a system designed to satisfy these requirements is compared to an equivalent linear system and is shown to become increasingly nonlinear as the system moves towards instability.},

This paper proposes improved analytical expressions for the torque on cuboidal permanent magnets applied to a magnetic bearing. These novel expressions are valid for any relative magnet position, especially when surfaces of the different magnets are in the same plane. Further, the torque can be obtained with respect to any reference point. Although these equations seem rather complicated, they enable an extremely fast and accurate calculation of the torque on a permanent magnet in the presence of a magnetic field of another permanent magnet.

  abstract = {Most of the systems working by magnet interactions can be calculated by superposition of the interactions between parallelepiped elementary magnets. Each elementary magnet is submitted to a force and a torque. By 3-D fully analytical calculation, up to now, only the force components problem has been solved. It was published for the first time in 1984. Until now, the torque components have never been analytically calculated because of the angular derivation. We have solved it, so that now all the interactions (energy, three forces components, and three torque components) can be expressed by analytical formulations. The only hypothesis is that the magnetizations J and J ' are supposed to be rigid and uniform in each magnet. The analytical calculation is made by replacing magnetizations by distributions of magnetic charges on the magnet poles. The torque is calculated for rotational movement of the second magnet around its center. The three components of the torque are written with functions based on logarithm and arc-tangent. The results have been verified and validated by comparison with finite-element calculation. Analytical calculation owns many advantages in comparison with other calculation methods. The 3-D analytical expressions are difficult to obtain, but the expressions of energy, force, and torque are very simple to use. For example, the analytical expression can be included in optimization software allowing to directly obtaining the shape optimization by a fast way.},

This theorem implies that the magnetic field components created by an infinite parallelepiped magnet can be deducted from the ones created by the same parallelepiped magnet with a perpendicular magnetization.

  abstract  = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to present novel analytical expressions which describe the 3D magnetic field of arbitrarily magnetized triangular-shaped charged surfaces. These versatile expressions model that the field of triangular-shaped permanent magnets (PMs) are very suitable to model skewed slotless machines. Design/methodology/approach – The analytical 3D surface charge method is normally used to provide field expressions for PMs in free space. In this paper, the analytical surface charge integrals are analytically solved for charged right-triangular surfaces. The resulting field is compared with that obtained by finite element modeling (FEM) and subsequently applied in two examples. Findings – The comparison with FEM shows that the 3D analytical expressions are very accurate and exhibit very low-numerical noise. These fast-solving versatile expressions are therefore considered suitable to model triangular-shaped or polyhedral-shaped PMs. Research limitations/implications – The surface charge method assumes that the relative permeability is equal to 1 and therefore soft-magnetic materials need to be modeled using the method of images. The PMs are assumed to be ideal in terms of homogeneity, magnetization vector, permeability, demagnetization, and geometrical tolerances. Practical implications – Many applications, such as the subclass of slotless synchronous linear actuators with a skewed PM structure and planar magnetic bearings, are very suitable to incorporate this modeling technique, since it enables the analysis of a variety of performance data. Originality/value – As an addition to the common 3D analytical field expressions for cuboidal or cylindrical PMs, this paper presents novel expressions for magnets having triangular surfaces.},

The proposed MST magnet array is a modified version of a Halbach magnet array. The MST array has trapezoidal magnets with variable shape and dimensions while the Halbach magnet array generally has a rectangular magnet with identical dimensions. We propose a new model that can describe the magnetic field resulting from the complex-shaped magnets. The model can be applied to both MST and conventional magnet arrays. Using the model, a design optimization of the two types of linear motors is performed and compared. The magnet array with trapezoidal magnets can produce more force than one with rectangular magnets when they are arrayed in a linear motor where there is a yoke with high permeability. After the optimization and comparison, we conclude that the linear motor with the MST magnet array can generate more actuating force per volume than the motor with the conventional array. In order to satisfy the requirements of next generation systems such as high resolution, high speed, and long stroke, the use of a linear motor with a MST array as an actuator in a high precision positioning system is recommended from the results obtained here.},

  year     = {2013},
  abstract = {Vibration disturbance has a consistent negative impact on equipment and processes. The central theme of this thesis is the investigation of using permanent magnets in the design of a system for vibration isolation. The thesis begins with a comprehensive literature review on the subjects of passive and active vibration isolation, permanent magnetic systems, and the common area between these on nonlinear vibration systems using magnetic forces. The use of cylindrical and cuboid magnets is the primary focus of this work for which analytical solutions are known for calculating forces and torques. Subsequently, the state of the art in analytical modelling of permanent magnet systems is covered, including a contribution in this area for calculating the forces between cylindrical magnets. A range of load bearing designs using simple permanent magnet arrangements are examined, with multiple designs suitable for a variety of objectives. A particular emphasis is placed on a system using inclined magnets, which can exhibit a load independent resonance frequency. Load bearing using multipole magnet arrays is also discussed, in which a large number of magnets are used to generate more complex magnetic fields. A variety of multipole arrays are compared against each other, including linear and planar magnetisation patterns, and an optimisation is performed on a linear array with some resulting guidelines for designing such systems for load bearing. Permanent magnet levitation requires either passive or active stabilisation; therefore, the design of electromagnetic actuators for active control is covered with a new efficient method for calculating the forces between a cylindrical magnet and a solenoid. The optimisation of a solenoid actuator is performed and geometric parameters are found which are near-optimal for a range of operating conditions. Two quasi–zero stiffness systems are introduced and analysed next. These systems are designed with a nonlinearity such that low stiffnesses are achieved while bearing large loads. The first system analysed is a purely mechanical device using linear springs; unlike most analyses of this design, the horizontal forces are also considered and it is shown that quasi–zero stiffness is capable in all translational directions simultaneously. However, a notable disadvantage of such spring systems is their difficulty in online tuning to adapt to changing operating conditions. A magnetic quasi–zero stiffness system is then analysed in detail and design criteria are introduced, providing a design framework for such systems and showing how the complex interaction of variables affects the resulting dynamic behaviour. Although the system is nonlinear, the effects of the nonlinearities on the vibration response are shown to be generally negligible. The thesis concludes with some experimental results of the same quasi–zero stiffness system, constructed as a single degree of freedom prototype. The quasistatic and dynamic behaviour of the system matches the theory well, and active vibration control is performed to improve the vibration isolation characteristics of the device.},

Near-square hysteresis loops and large values of the coercivity and anisotropy fields greatly simplify magnet design, as each magnet block is effectively transparent to the magnetic fields produced elsewhere in the magnet assembly. The fields generated by compact and efficient magnet structures requiring no continuous expenditure of energy can be static or variable, uniform or nonuniform. Permanent magnets are fully competitive with electromagnets for fields up to 2T, and fields as high as to 5T can be produced in a small volume. When a field with a rapid spatial variation is required, permanent magnets may offer the only practicable solution. Both permanent magnet structures and the uses to which they are put are reviewed, classifying the magnet applications in terms of the nature of the field, the effect on the magnet and the physical effect exploited.},

By using the equivalence between the amperian current model and the coulombian model of a magnet, we show that a thin coil or a cylindrical magnet axially magnetized have the same mathematical model. Consequently, we present first the analytical expressions of the magnetic field produced by either a thin coil or a ring permanent magnet whose polarization is axial, thus completing similar calculations already published in the scientific literature. Then, this paper deals with the analytical calculation of the force and the stiffness between thin coils or ring permanent magnets axially magnetized. Such configurations can also be modeled with the same mathematical approach. Finally, this paper presents an analytical model of the mutual inductance between two thin coils in air. Throughout this paper, we emphasize why the equivalence between the coulombian and the amperian current models is useful for studying thin coils or ring permanent magnets. All our analytical expressions are based on elliptic integrals but do not require further numerical treatments. These expressions can be implemented in Mathematica or Matlab and are available online. All our models have been compared to previous analytical and semianalytical models. In addition, these models have been compared to the finite-element method. The computational cost of our analytical model is very low, and we find a very good agreement between our analytical model and the other approaches presented in this paper.},

This article describes a study on interaction force along three degrees of freedom (DoF) between permanent magnets having an unaligned magnetization direction for use in a permanent-magnet based suspension application. Feasibility of finite element modeling (FEM) and analytical modelling for such structures is discussed, implemented and verified with measurements.},

  abstract = {Due to their wide use in industrial and commercial devices, it is important to accurately and effectively model permanent magnets, leading to better magnet designs and more desirable magnetic characteristics. In recent decades, researchers have derived equations describing magnetic fields, forces, and torques, but these are usually limited to cuboid or ring-shaped magnets. Some authors have derived magnetic field equations for polyhedral magnets, allowing more general magnet shapes, but these are either not fully simplified or computationally inefficient. This paper presents a new set of simplified and exact equations describing the magnetic field produced by an arbitrarily-shaped polyhedral permanent magnet with constant uniform magnetisation and a relative permeability of unity. These equations were implemented in Matlab code and validated using finite element simulations and literature. These equations are significantly faster than finite element simulations, and can therefore be used for efficient optimisation of magnet geometry or topology, real-time simulations, and for approximation of curved surfaces of permanent magnets.},

  abstract = {This article presents an improved surface charge model for the static force calculation among the permanent magnets (PMs). Generally, there is an error source of the classical surface magnetic charge model due to the assumption of the unit relative permeability. This error source can be ignored for the ferromagnetic actuators but will bring a significant deviation to the ironless devices, such as the magnetic bearings or magnetic springs. To calculate the static force among the PMs more accurately, the estimation for the actual working point of each PM is required. The magnetic field iteration method is used in this article, in which the inner magnetic field intensity of one PM is decided by itself and the external magnetic field sources. By dividing one cuboid magnet into amounts of small cubes, the integral operation can be simplified into the numerical superposition when calculating the average working point. The influences of the number of nodes and iteration times on the model accuracy are analyzed. Finally, two magnetic springs are manufactured and well tested. The static force calculation is based on the expressions of Yonnet and the improved surface charge model. Compared with the classical model, the model error of the improved model can be reduced and the static force values are closer to the 3-D finite-element method (FEM) and experiment results. Furthermore, the improved model has remarkable advantage over the 3-D FEM in aspect of computation time, which is suitable for the design and analysis of the magnetic bearing or magnetic springs.},

  abstract   = {The lodestone is an extremely rare form of the mineral magnetite (Fe3O4) that occurs naturally as a permanent magnet. It therefore attracts metallic iron as well as fragments of ordinary ‘inert’ magnetite. This ‘magic’ property was known to many ancient cultures, and a powerful lodestone has always commanded a high price. By the eleventh century AD the Chinese had discovered that a freely suspended elongated lodestone would tend to set with its long axis approximately north–south, and utilized this property in the magnetic compass. They also appear to have discovered that this invaluable characteristic could be handed-on to a steel needle if the latter were contacted with, or stroked by, a lodestone. The magnetism of the lodestone was scientifically investigated by William Gilbert in the sixteenth century, when he defined its ‘poles' and the well-known rule that ‘like poles repel, unlike attract’. He also studied ‘inclination’ and ‘variation’, and means to aid the preservation of magnetic power. How to concentrate it by ‘arming’ the lodestone with caps or pole-pieces of soft iron was discovered in the same century. These methods have been repeated, confirmed, and improved. The lodestone occupies a vital place in the history of magnetism, but little beyond Gilbert's work can be reached by historical studies because vastly improved steel or alloy permanent magnets, and electromagnets, replaced it before quantitative measurements were developed. These techniques have therefore been applied retrospectively to both museum specimens and contemporary natural lodestones. A good source of the latter was found to be the igneous complex known as Magnet Cove, Arkansas, and this material has been used as the ‘type example’. All specimens were discrete, well-rounded, rusty brown pebbles found near the surface. Their unweathered interiors were black titanomagnetite. No significant trace element or crystallographic differences could be found between the lodestones and the magnetically inert material that always accompanied them. The magnetic moment per unit volume (J v) of the ‘as-found’ Magnet Cove lodestones varied between 6.5 and 11.6 emu cm-3, which compares poorly with the hundreds of units characteritzing modern permanent magnets. Hysteresis loops gave a saturation intensity (J s) of 27–51 emu cm-3, suggesting that intensity has diminished since formation. This agrees with general experience of magnets, especially in the absence of a ‘keeper’. The initial volume susceptibility of Magnet Cove magnetite was about 0.18 for low fields, and always remained {\textless}1. This means that a normal terrestrial magnetic field with a maximum vector {\textless}1 Oe is unable to induce even the low magnetic moments we see today, while a field approaching 1000 Oe is required for saturation. These parameters, and the rare occurrence of lodestones as near-surface fragments, support suggestions that they are the product of a lightning strike upon an exposure of a suitable (titanium-rich?) magnetite. Transient currents averaging 30 000 A have been measured. This would give rise to a zone of potential magnetic saturation at least 12 cm in diameter, to which some of the ejected fragments would be exposed. An attempt to determine the period elapsed since formation of the Magnet Cove lodestone was made by annealing magnetically saturated specimens at temperatures up to 500°C, and measuring J v at weekly intervals for 100 days. The decay curves visually resembled exponential functions, but mathematical tests proved that they were not strictly so. Interpretation was therefore difficult, but a pragmatic procedure involving excessive extrapolation suggested an ‘age’ of about 3500 years.},

New materials such as these have spawned many new markets for magnets, with significant performance gains in the devices for which they are used. Until now, however, there has been no text that unified all the relevant information on the wide range of modern permanent magnet materials.

What wonder, then, that it was thought that in this way the geographical longitude could be determined! Christopher Columbus and Sebastian Cabot had already thought of the possibility of such a solution of this, the most important of the nautical problems of that time, and in the sixteenth century the number of those who sought to ascertain the longitude magnetically increased very materially. The fact that the line of no declination, or the agonic line, almost coincided with the zero meridian as adopted at that time—at least in that part of the Atlantic Ocean traversed by voyagers to the West Indies-certainly helped not a little to continually strengthen the belief in the possibility of determining the longitude with the aid of the compass. The agonic line was looked upon as a point of departure given by Nature herself for the reckoning of longitude.},

The first step, therefore, in reducing these phenomena into scientific form, is to ascertain the magnitude and direction of the force acting between the bodies, and when it is found that this force depends in a certain way upon the relative position of the bodies and on their electric or magnetic condition, it seems at first sight natural to explain the facts by assuming the existence of something either at rest or in motion in each body, constituting its electric or magnetic state, and capable of acting at a distance according to mathematical laws. In this way mathematical theories of statical electricity, of magnetism, of the mechanical action between conductors carrying currents, and of the induction of currents have been formed. In these theories the force acting between the two bodies is treated with reference only to the condition of the bodies and their relative position, and without any express consideration of the surrounding medium.},

  abstract = {The interaction force and torque between two parallelepiped magnets can be analytically calculated by “magnetic nodes.” The obtained expressions only depend on the corner positions. It leads F. Bancel to propose the notion of magnetic nodes situated at the corner positions. The force and torque components can be directly calculated with the magnetic nodes representation. The only hypothesis is that the magnets are supposed to be perfect (polarizations J and J' constant, rigid and uniform). The analytical calculation is made by replacing polarizations by distributions of magnetic charges on the poles. The torque is calculated for rotational movement of the second magnet around its center. The three components of the force and the torque can be written with functions based on logarithm and arc-tangent. The representation by magnetic nodes is correct from a mathematical point of view. But attention must be paid to the fact that the magnetic nodes cannot be isolated from the others. The whole force is correct even when the value on the magnetic nodes is not. Meanwhile, the magnetic node representation is very suitable for global interaction understanding and for force and torque calculation.},

  abstract = {Nonclassical structures of permanent-magnet cylindrical air-gap couplings with progressive magnetization are studied. In these couplings, parallelepiped magnets with nonclassical magnetization direction are used and stuck in ironless cores. The magnetization direction of each magnet is chosen to provide an optimal repartition of the induction in the air gap. This progressive magnetization allows very high values of pullout torque. The use of this type of structure with ironless cores and very high pull-out torque seems to be an advantageous way to minimize the inertia and maximize the pullout torque of a magnetic coupling. An efficient method to calculate the torque of such a coupling is presented, based on analytical formulas for forces between magnets. It allows the exact evaluation of the performance of the studied couplings when the main dimensions of the coupling are varying with small calculation time. In this paper the influence of the number of pole pairs, the influence of the number of magnets per pole, the influence of the magnets' thickness, the influence of the air-gap radius, and the influence of the length of the structure are studied and discussed. Then some general rules are presented for efficient design of such a coupling.},

  abstract = {Generally, linear motor is used as actuators for high precision stage which requires long stroke, high speed and high precision capability. In order to meet the needs of high speed and high precision, it is important that the motor generates large force and has small size. In this paper we propose a linear motor with multi-segmented (MST) magnet array to maximize actuating force per unit volume. The MST magnet array is a modified version of standard Halbach magnet array. Each magnet in the MST magnet array has various shapes and dimensions while standard Halbach magnet array has identical magnets. In order to optimize the shapes and dimensions, design optimization of the motor is carried out and its performance is investigated. We conclude that the linear motor with the MST array can generate more actuating force per unit volume than the one with conventional magnet array and standard Halbach magnet array. A high precision stage is constructed using the optimized MST magnet array. Even though we obtain maximized actuating force, the flux density by the MST array is seriously distorted from ideal sinusoidal flux density with respect to mover position. This distorted flux density results in force ripples when we use three phase commutation. And no matter how small force ripples would be, serious tracking errors occur in high precision linear stages. Thus, force ripple must be compensated. In this paper, we proposed a simple method to reduce the ripple by current shaping.},

Devices running by attraction were the first to be built. When new magnets, which can be used in repulsion appeared on the market (SmCo5), new types of passive magnetic bearings, running by repulsion, started to be made. Up to now, to our knowledge, most of the devices realized have been made with radially magnetized rings. We proved that for identically shaped bearings, strengths and stiffnesses were exactly the same in both magnetic configurations : radial and axial magnetization. The proof is only based on the rigidity of the magnetization. These results are still true for axial or radial passive bearings, and can also be used for devices in attraction. Ring shaped magnets with radial magnetization are usually made of several sectors stuck together. Axial magnetization is much easier to manufacture because large sized rings are already industrially provided.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a very simple experiment, which favours the original Ampère force and unambiguously disproves the Biot-Savart force of relativity, or its approximation in a covariant relativistic form, namely the Lorentz force. This experiment with its extra degree of freedom has the advantage over the many other similar ones, including Ampère’s original experiment, which have been performed in the past and recently by Graneau, of giving results which are both qualitative and quantitative, as well as unambiguous. Due to the strong association of the Biot-Savart and Lorentz force to relativistic theories, the experiment can also be considered as limiting the generality of these theories.},

  abstract = {The potential benefits of frustum-shaped magnets over cuboidal magnets have been seldom studied. This article compares these magnet shapes by optimizing frustum geometry for both a single magnet and a multi-magnet planar Halbach array to produce a desirable field. This field is compared to the equivalent field for optimized cuboidal magnets and differences quantified. A single magnet is considered, where the field strength above the center of a magnet is maximized. If the field is measured close to the magnet surface, an optimized frustum magnet can produce a field stronger than an optimized cuboidal magnet. If the field is measured further from the magnet, there is little benefit in using a frustum magnet over a cuboid. In addition, a planar magnet array is considered, in which the field strength and how closely the field resembled a sinusoidal profile are maximized. In this case, no significant benefit is observed using frustum magnets over cuboidal magnets.},

  abstract = {A design for a permanent magnet system is proposed that generates spatially homogeneous, constant magnetic field gradients, thus creating conditions suitable for MRI without gradient coils and amplifiers. This is achieved by superimposing a weak Halbach quadrupole on a strong Halbach dipole. Rotation of either the quadrupole or the entire magnet assembly can be used to generate two-dimensional images via filtered backprojection. Additionally, the mutual rotation of two quadrupoles can be used to scale the resulting gradient. If both gradients have identical strength the gradient can even be made to vanish. The concept is demonstrated by analytical considerations and FEM simulations. However, a demonstration on a working prototype is still pending. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract   = {Magnets of the Halbach layout are interesting for the use in mobile NMR/MRI devices. Therefore, the ideal Halbach magnet was iterated using identical bar magnets, which are positioned and oriented based on analytical equations. These configurations were simulated with two-dimensional finite-element methods. Performance factors were defined to relate field strength with homogeneity and mass. A geometry of 16 magnets provided a good compromise between performance and special requirements for the desired use to store hyperpolarized xenon. The construction of such a magnet required the design of dedicated support frames and procedures to mount them. The field strength and homogeneity in the finished magnet were measured by a Hall probe and agreed well with the simulations. The calculation and construction are described in detail and together with the tabled field values for n magnets with n = 80 may prove helpful for building similar devices, which were named NMR Mandhalas (Magnet Arrangements for Novel Discrete Halbach Layout). © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract  = {Undulators and wigglers based on Halbach arrays have been in widespread use since their description in the 1980s, due to the high fields they generate from permanent magnets. The most common implementation of a pure permanent magnet Halbach undulator consists of four magnetic segment widths per undulator period. In typical undulators with periods of order ~cm it is straightforward to use sufficiently small magnetic segments to achieve the desired undulator period. However, in the context of new microundulators with periods of order ~mm or shorter, there is a lower bound on the feature sizes achievable by existing fabrication techniques. This motivates the use of modified Halbach arrays comprised of right triangle magnet segments with only two magnet segment widths per undulator period. These configurations are demonstrated to have superior field strengths to up-down arrays with no increase to the undulator period. Additional considerations arising from the broken symmetries in such configurations, such as the presence of previously forbidden harmonic components, are also considered. Such right triangle Halbach arrays may be fabricated using MEMS techniques for use in the next generation of compact light sources.},

We present a self-consistent quantitative analysis of the magnetization and magnetic induction distributions inside the magnetic array by considering the anisotropic and nonlinear magnetization functions of the materials consisting of the array. These numeric simulations reveal novel magnetization structures resulted from the self-field of array. We demonstrate that both the field uniformity and magnetic flux in the pole gap can be modulated by partially substituting the magnets of high energy products with the soft irons and the superhard magnets. We also show how the optimized substitution parameters can be obtained for a HCPMA achieving the best field uniformity or the maximum magnetic flux.},
