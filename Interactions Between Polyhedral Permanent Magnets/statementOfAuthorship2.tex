    Contribution & \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{-2mm}
        \item[-] Idea conceptualisation
        \item[-] Review of relevant literature
        \item[-] Developed polyhedral decomposition methodology
        \item[-] Performed all mathematical analysis, including computer-aided algebra and simplification of long and complication mathematical expressions
        \item[-] Identified singularities in the solutions for the field equations and treated these singularities, giving alternate formulations at the singular points
